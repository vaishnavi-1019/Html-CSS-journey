we have two units like absolute and relative 
absolute will be fixed 
and relative one will be relative to another parent or something like chaging not fixed 


(1) absolute:-

in
cm
mm
pt 
pc

(2) relative one :-

em 
rem 
%
vw 
vh 
vmin
vmax

% for relative to parent or child 

vh vw - for whole view of window 

physical pixel :-light emitting dot related like fix dot in hardware screen

while logical pixel is:- used by developers who use this for keeping element size consistent across different screen sizes.

rem-for root element 
body is root -16px 
if we do font size 5rem 
than it mul 16*5 =80 px
